# CalorieCounterUI

Counts the number of calories, proteins, carbohydrates and fat a person needs per day, based on:
- age
- weight
- height
- physical activity
- sex

Secondly the user can select food with the search function and add it to a table. The counter then calculates the number of calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fat that amount of food would add up to.

Everything is implemented with a javaFX UI.
